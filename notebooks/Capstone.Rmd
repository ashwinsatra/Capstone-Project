## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)     # For reading Excel files
library(dplyr)      # For data manipulation
library(ggplot2)    # For visualization
```

## Including Plots

Assuming you're working with the FoodValue sheet.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Set your file path
file_path <- "path_to_your/FoodImports.xlsx"

# Read the 'FoodValue' sheet
food_value <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "FoodValue")

# View first few rows
head(food_value)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
